<h1>My Profile</h1>
<img src="profile picture.jpg" style="width:250px;height:250px;">
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<h3>Name:</h3>
<p>Nathan Layt</p>
<h3>Student ID:</h3> <p>3831623</p>

<h3>Email:</h3>
<p>s3831623@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
<h3>Information:</h3> 
<p>I am a 33 year old from Brisbane, I am 7-8th generation Australian with mostly Scottish and English 
heritage.</p>

<p>I went to school at Westside Christian College, I worked for Murrays Mining Services, a family company specializing in
 underground coal mining machinery parts and repairs, I worked as a Service Clerk then a Sales Administrator at Komatsu and
 I worked as a Geotechnician for Xstrata Mount Isa Mines. I left school during year 11 but I have completed a lot of education
 throughout my career including Certificate III in Process Manufacturing and Certificate IV Trainer and Assessor.</p>

<p>I started travelling overseas when I was 15 and I’ve been to over 20 countries, with long stays in Germany and Thailand.
 I have forgotten most of my German language but I speak Thai ok with a north-eastern dialect.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your 
interest? Outline your IT experience</h3>
<p>I have an interest in IT because I have always been successful in roles that are IT intensive, largely due to the fact that
 I have always developed IT skills due to my interest in relevant technologies and applications outside of a work environment.
 My interest in IT started when I was very young, playing computer games and eventually upgrading my own computers to run more 
demanding games. I developed an interest in upgrading computers when I first had to upgrade the memory on my PC to run a game
 called “Nascar”. I have a lot of Office Suite experience from working in administration roles and I have experience with data 
management and even some programming after my role as a Geothechnician.</p>

<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
<p>RMIT offered the best pathway to a degree that fit my plans for the future, I selected this unit as an individual subject 
through Open Universities Australia.</p>
<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
<p>I expect to learn a broad range of industry skills that I can use in the workplace. Specifically I expect to learn a few programming
 languages so that I will be a suitable candidate for a role I want to secure in the future, and I plan to make sure of this with my elective
 unit selections.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<h3>Job Title</h3>
<p>Graduate/ Junior Developer – Vela Software</p>
<h3>Why is it Attractive?</h3>
<p>This job is desirable for me because it is based in Brisbane and serves as an ideal role to gain industry experience after completing my 
education</p>
<h3>Skills, qualifications & experience needed</h3>	
 	<p>Experience with web based technologies (C#, ASP.NET, Web Forms, JavaScript, CSS)
	Sound understanding of programming principles, development methodologies and tool sets.

	Proven ability to complete project related activities within budget and agreed time frames
	Demonstrated ability to uphold a high level of professionalism in all interactions</p>

<p>(These requirement can be covered by my previous work experience combined with my future education plans. In particular I would need to use 
my elective subjects effectively to ensure I develop required skills in web based technologies, programming principles & XML)</p>

<h2>Project Idea<h2>
<h3>Project</h3>
A social media platform that tracks and displays the user’s travel destinations, dates, travel goals etc.
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The platform would be aimed specifically at people that frequently travel overseas. It would serve as an accurate record of travel destinations 
and dates, as well as giving the user a feeling of accomplishment with every location added.</p> 
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>This is something that I would very much like to use myself and as such I believe it would be a desirable platform for a lot of
 people like me that see travel as a central part of their life. People that travel often want to share their experience and this platform would be
 an ideal way to do that, while helping them keep accurate records for themselves. Meeting people is also a key part of travelling which makes the 
platform desirable for travellers that want to stay in touch.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Users would sign up using their name, email address, DOB etc.</p>

<p>A single profile picture would be a central part of the user profile, this picture could be changed at any time however the platform would not store
 multiple profile pictures.</p> 

<p>Central to the profile would be a map highlighting travelled destinations, with an option to select specific locations to record / reveal more 
detailed information.</p>

<p>The user would enter travel times to display an accurate timeline. As previous travel may have been a long time ago and exact dates could be 
difficult, trips that are entered into a profile would have optional selection for the year, month and day.</p>

<p>Number of countries travelled to would be prominently displayed and have the feel of a “score” for the profile.</p>

<p>You could add photos of specific destinations by selecting the relevant trip. The maximum number of photos for each country / trip would be quite 
limited as their purpose would mostly be for the memory of the profile user / proof of the trip / historical record more than the option of photos 
taking over the desired purpose of the platform if people wanted to flood their profiles with travel pics they wanted to share with their friends / 
the community.</p>

<p>Users would be part of a network of friends that could view each other’s profiles and share their current travel activities.</p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>There are websites such as ning.com, yoocoo.org and appypie.com that are designed for you to build your own social media platforms. 
These offer a variety of social network features, file sharing capabilities, websites, forum / chat options, picture / video capabilities 
and monetization solutions. However to ensure complete ownership and control of the platform it would be best to build a website from scratch,
 with the option of developing an app for it later.</p>

<p>A web hosting provider would be required to register the domain name / URL. Some options for this are siteground.com, NameCheap, GoDaddy. 
The appropriate hosting option would need to be selected to allow for sufficient traffic, data storage, etc.</p>

<p>GitHub would be central to software development collaboration and version control and used in conjunction with Atom, a free and open-source 
text and source code editor.</p>

<p>Other potential web development tools include MDB (a popular framework for building websites and apps), WebDataRocks (a free JavaScript library
 for web reporting and analysis), Creative Tim (a web and mobile app design tool), TypeScript (an open-source front end scripting language), 
CodeKit (a front-end web development tool) and many others.</p>

<p>Significant funding would be required, especially for the web hosting and possibly also for full functionality of other required tools.

<h3>Skills Required</h3> 	
<p>To build and launch this platform in a reasonable timeframe a project team would be required, made up of appropriately educated and experienced
 software developers, web developers, programmers and any other necessary IT professionals.</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>If the project were successful, the result would be a social media platform that could gain popularity by relying on users to suggest it’s use to 
their friends, and more specifically to other travellers. It would be an excellent way of keeping an accurate record of travel in the user’s lifetime.<p>
